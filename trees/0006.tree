\title{CUCaTS Code Golf Contest}
\p{
    I'm running a Code Golf contest for [CUCaTS](cucats) on 2025-10-20. This was inspired by a similar event ran by [UCCPS](uccps),
    but I want to make the participant experience as smooth as possible. To do this, I'm using an online judge for this event, and potential future events.
    Most judging software is designed specifically for competitive programming, thus, this judge had to be custom written.
    Fortunately, a great tool [ioi/isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate) exists, which made the sandboxing job very easy.
