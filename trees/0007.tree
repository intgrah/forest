\p{
    I'm enjoying my new keyboard, a Cherry MX 10.0N RGB, gifted by a friend.
    The profile is extremely low, and so is the distance required to actualise a keypress; barely a millimeter down counts as a key press.
    I'm still yet to figure out if this improves typing speed or not, although I'd like to say it does. I'm hitting around 120 WPM with it.
